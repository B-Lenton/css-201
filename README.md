# CSS 201 Final Project

##### An early CSS Project used to practice web design

This project focuses on CSS use but it does also feature a small amount of JavaScript and, inevitably, HTML as well.

*This was created after the second course I completed on CSS. I have since developed my CSS and HTML ability further, but this is still a good barometer of what I could do early in my development.*
